This is a project to build a DIY differential probe for oscilloscopes (CRT or DSO)
This project was based on an earlier version of a few years ago and went through a number of enhancements based on what we learned.

There are now three versions of the probe, a 1MHz, a 10MHz and a 100MHz version.
These three versions can be powered by a number of so called Daughter Boards.
Two are listed here. 
There is also a 3D printed version of the probe enclosure available.
The files in this project folder contain the schematics, the BOM and the production information to order the PCB's and enclosure.
All other information about this project can be found on my Blog here:
